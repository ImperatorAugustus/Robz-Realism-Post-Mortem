Gs being used in the anti-tank role. The StuH 42 mounts a LeFH 18 howitzer on a StuG III chassis. This vehicle is suitable for both demolishing fortifications, laying down a smoke shield, limited anti-tank work and wasting HEAT on half-tracks. To add to the fun, the vehicle has a sub-standard reload time so using it as a tank destroyer is utterly fruitless and has a very limited range so using it as an artillery piece is not advised either."}

Thanks to its good ride performance, this vehicle became very popular among German troops and was widely used in the initial battles of World War II. An automatic gun installed on its small rotating turret, coupled with a 20mm machine gun, proved effective at striking enemy personnel and light armored equipment. However, the insufficient protection of the SdKfz 222 led to its being downgraded to reconnaissance and support equipment."}

It featured a redesigned turret, the new cast commander's cupola, a mounting bracket for an anti-aircraft MG 34 on the cupola, a ball-mounted MG 34 in the frontal plate and standard side armor skirts. The side skirts and the brackets holding them had to be removed for transport by rail as the width of the Panther reached the maximum clearance for transport by rail. Over time, five different types of exhaust arrangement were used. In general, from August 1943 to May 1944, some 2,200 were produced by MAN, Daimler-Benz, Demag and Henschel."}

It was an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Soviet armour encountered in the initial months of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1. The Tiger I design gave the Wehrmacht its first tank mounting the 88 mm gun in its initial armored fighting vehicle-dedicated version which in its FlaK version had previously demonstrated its effectiveness against both air and ground targets. During the course of the war, the Tiger I saw combat on all German battlefronts. The initial official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausfuhrung H ('Panzer VI version H', abbreviated PzKpfw VI Ausf. H), but the tank was redesignated as PzKpfw VI Ausf.

The chassis of the Panther tank was the ideal base upon which to construct a new tank destroyer. It was given a new cabin with a good ballistic profile, and a long-barrelled PaK 43/3 gun, able to penetrate the armor of any enemy tank even at long range. Its formidable firepower, high mobility and low profile made the Jagdpanther one of the most powerful and renowned tank destroyers."}
		{"elefant" "The Elefant tank destroyer entered service with the Wehrmacht in the spring of 1943. Its cabin-mounted 88mm gun was considered to be the deadliest weapon of its time, and gave it the capacity to destroy most enemy tanks from beyond their range of effective fire. Its armor -- up to 200mm thick -- made the Elefant impervious to frontal attacks, but its resulting heavy weight limited its speed and hindered its cross-country capability."}

Because of this, this vehicle was given the 88 FlaK 41 as its main and only armament."}
        {"sdkfz7_2" "The SdKfz 7/2 was a half-track military vehicle used by the German Wehrmacht Heer, armed with a 3.7 cm FlaK 36 anti-aircraft gun."}
		{"sdkfz234_1" "The SdKfz 234 was an eight-wheeled armoured car used by the German Army in the Second World War. 234/1 - 1 x 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon, 1 x MG34 Machinegun. This design featured an open-topped turret. Around 200 were produced."}
        {"sdkfz251_1_stuka" "The SdKfz 251/1 Was a World War II German armored fighting vehicle designed by the Hanomag company, based on its earlier, unarmored SdKfz 11 vehicle. The 251/1 was designed with Rocket launcher called the Stuka zu Fuss equipped with six side mounted frames for launching 280mm or 320mm Wurfkoerper rockets."}
        {"sdkfz138_1" "The SdKfz 138/1 Was a series of self propelled artillery vehicles used by Nazi Germany during World War II. The Grille series was based on the Czech Panzer 38(t) tank chassis and used a 15 cm sIG 33 infantry gun."}
        {"sdkfz250_1" "The SdKfz 250/1 Was a light armoured halftrack, very similar in appearance to the larger Hanomag-designed SdKfz 251, and built by the DEMAG firm, for use by Nazi Germany in World War II. Most variants were open-topped and had a single access door in the rear mount with a machine gun."} 
        {"kfz15_gun" "The Kfz.15 Horch Were supplied to the Wehrmacht between 1936 and 1943 in the three versions Leichter Einheits-PKW, Mittlerer Einheits-PKW and Schwerer Einheits-PKW (light, medium and heavy passenger car). These vehicles were supposed to replace the civilian vehicles previously procured by the Reichswehr with cross-country mobile vehicles that conformed with military requirements while simplifying logistics and maintenance by using standardized components. The program achieved neither of these goals."}
        {"mg34_stan" "The Maschinengewehr 34, or MG 34, is a German recoil-operated air-cooled machine gun, first tested in 1929, introduced in 1934, and issued to units in 1936. It introduced an entirely new concept in automatic firepower, the Einheitsmaschinengewehr Universal machine gun and is generally considered the world's first general purpose machine gun."}
        {"wespe_ger2" "The Wespe married the Panzer II tank chassis (which was no longer viable as a tank after 1940), to the 105 mm leFH 18 Howitzer, producing a self-propelled artillery unit which proved both functional and reliable. This combination afforded it a place in armored artillery battalions, serving alongside the heavier Hummel self-propelled guns. It proved to be a very successful vehicle when it first saw combat on the Eastern Front, and soon all Panzer II production was dedicated to turning out these vehicles. Nearly 700 had been produced by the end of the war."}
        {"t34_3_ger2" "This modification entered service with the Red Army on January 23rd, 1944. In order to mount a powerful 85mm anti-tank gun, some changes had to be introduced into its turret design: it became larger and more heavily protected. Its side and rear armor was also enhanced, which, in combination with its sharp slope angle, significantly increased the shell resistance of the hull. As a result the T-34's weight increased to 32 tons, making the tank a bit slower, but its combat efficiency rose significantly."}
        {"sgrw42_ger2" "The design of this 81mm gun closely follows its Soviet counterpart, consisting of three main sections: the firing tube, support plate and a two-legged mount. It fires 3.5kg HE rounds via indirect trajectory. Firing is triggered by the pin inside the tube striking the primer of a descending shell."}
        {"sfh18_ger2" "In production since 1918, the SFH-18 heavy field howitzer was used by the Wehrmacht troops during WWII, against enemy artillery and personnel, as well as fortifications and trench lines. It fired 43kg HE rounds, capable of dealing devastating damage at very long distances, but the gun's heavy weight impaired its mobility."}
        {"sdkfz234_ger2" "The SdKfz 234 armored, all-wheel drive vehicle was mass produced in 1943. Thanks to sloping armor plates, the hull protected the crew not only from shell fragments and infantry weapons, but also from low-calibre artillery fire. Moreover, the powerful engine allowed the vehicle to achieve high speeds, and its armament proved to be very effective against enemy infantry and lightly-armored vehicles, winning the \"Puma\" the rightfully deserved title of 'best armored car of WWII'."}
        {"r12_ger2" "One of the most successful German motorcycle models entered mass production in 1934. Fast, and armed with an MG-34 machine-gun (mounted on a sidecar), the R-12 became very popular amongst the Wehrmacht motorized troops."}
        {"r12_ptrd" "A R12 motorcycle equipped with a really capable (stolen) anti-tank rifle. It poses a serious target to light vehicles and emplacements."}
        {"pz6bh_ger2" "This unit entered service with the Wehrmacht in 1944. Its turret-mounted 88mm long-barrelled gun was capable of destroying any enemy tank from a long distance. Combined with excellent armor, this made the King Tiger the most powerful tank of WWII. The Pz VI Ausf.B was almost invulnerable to enemy guns, but its 70 ton weight had a negative impact on its mobility."}
        {"pz6e_ger2" "This unit entered service with the German army in 1942 and was considered the best tank right up until the end of 1943. Soviet 45mm guns could not penetrate the Tiger's armor, even at point-blank range, while its 88mm gun was able to destroy any tank of that time."}		
        {"tigerp_robztest"	"On May 21, 1942, the Henschel and Porsche companies presented their 45-ton heavy tank design capable of carrying the 88mm bore, 56 caliber long tank gun (88 mm KwK L/56). Krupp had already designed the gun turrets for the guns, and the armored bodies had to be designed accordingly. Porsche - led by Ferdinand Porsche - further developed the previous VK 30.01 (P) medium tank prototype and used some of its parts for the new tank. It is DennisBlaze's favourite tank."}
        {"pz5g_ger2" "The Ausf. G Panther version was created as a response to the Soviet T34, and entered mass production in March 1944. Its relatively good manoeuvrability and a long-barrelled 75mm gun made this tank a dangerous adversary. Its insufficient side protection was compensated for by its excellent frontal armor."}
        {"pz4h_ger2" "In April 1943, another modification of the most popular German tank came to the front. This machine differed from its predecessors, having enhanced armor and improved armament. Its armor was 80mm thick, and the mounted screens on its sides ensured reliable protection from high-explosion rounds. The new long-barrelled Kwk40 L/48 boasted excellent combat performance and was successfully used to fight medium enemy tanks."}
        {"pz4g_ger2" "The first version of the Pz.IV assault tank turned out to be ineffective against Soviet T34s and KVs. However, by the spring of 1942, the Wehrmacht started receiving new versions of the PzKpfw IV tanks, complete with upgraded armament and long-barrelled anti-tank Kwk40 guns, capable of defeating almost any opponent. In addition, the tank had good manoeuvrability, which -- along with its strong armor and powerful gun -- turned it into a fearsome combat vehicle."}
        {"pz3m_ger2" "In order to clear minefields, German engineers developed a special mine roller. When mounted upon the chassis of a Pz.Kpfw.III tank, it allowed the vehicle to drive through minefields unharmed. The resulting corridors were then used by infantry and ordinary tanks. It was armed with only a machine-gun."}
        {"pz3f_ger2" "The PzKpfw III Ausf. F was intended to fight alongside other tanks, using the same 37mm PaK 36 type gun favoured by the infantry at that time. This cannon provided adequate armament until 1940. Thankfully, the Panzer III design accommodated a larger armament, greatly increasing its lifespan once a larger cannon was required."}
        {"pz3_ger2" "The PzKpfw III entered mass production in September 1939. One year later, it received improved armor, as well as a new, long-barrelled 50mm gun. The tank was able to successfully engage and destroy armored cars and light tanks, although with the appearance of the T-34 it became largely obsolete."}
        {"pz1b_ger2" "Thanks to its six-cylinder Maybach engine, the Pz.I light tank -- mass produced since July 1943 -- was fast and manoeuvrable, while its turret-mounted double machine guns proved to be excellent against enemy infantry. However, its light armor and lack of sufficient armament rendered the Pz.I useless in tank battles."}
        {"pz1_ger2" "The Flakpanzer I is a self propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer I chassis. Up to this point, motorized flak vehicles had been unarmored, and prone to small arms fire and other common weapons. Joining a Flak 38 to the readily available Panzer I chassis provided a minimal amount of protection, and the vehicle also had substantial anti-aircraft and anti-infantry capabilities due to its 20mm cannon. However, it still lacked sufficient protection for combat use and crews suffered high casualty rates."}
        {"pak40_ger2" "The first guns of this type appeared during the spring of 1942, on the Eastern Front. The PaK 40 was designed to take on tanks and armored vehicles, however, its fairly large calibre and the availability of high-explosive rounds allowed it to be used to suppress weapon emplacements, demolish light fortifications and eliminate enemy personnel. Its accuracy and effective range exceed that of the Soviet ZIS-3 field artillery gun."}
        {"pak38_ger2" "The 50mm PaK 38 was the successor to the 37mm PaK 36, and the predecessor to the 75mm PaK 40. When the Soviets introduced their T-34, the PaK 38 was one of the few anti-tank guns capable of penetrating its armor at the time. Though this weapon was replaced by the PaK 40 and other more-powerful anti-tank weapons, the PaK 38 remained in useful service until the end of the war."}
        {"pak36_ger2" "The PaK 36 being a small-calibre weapon, it was found to be inadequate against allied medium and heavy tanks. Still, the gun was effective against the most common light tanks. During the initial phases of Operation Barbarossa the PaK 36 could still penetrate the majority of Soviet tanks at ranges up to 1000m from the front."}
        {"ostwind_ger2" "The PzKpfw IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret which housed a 3.7 cm FlaK 43. In addition to its intended role as an anti-aircraft weapon, the fast-firing gun was highly effective against light vehicles and minor fortifications. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun."}
        {"nashorn_ger2" "Mass production of the Nashorn tank destroyer started in February 1943 and continued until the end of the war. Its 88mm gun was merciless towards enemy tanks who had little defense against it. That, combined with its great mobility, made the \"Rhinoceros\" a fearsome weapon. Its frontal armor was thick enough, but the open fighting compartment and almost vertical side armor plates did not provide sufficient protection to the crew."}
        {"lefh18_ger2" "The le. FH 18 was the standard field howitzer used by the Wehrmacht during World War II, capable of firing a 15kg projectile a distance of nearly 11 kilometres, at a rate of about 5 rounds per minute. During the war it underwent several modifications to increase various areas of performance, and it remained in active use throughout the entire war."}
        {"jagdtiger_ger2" "In the summer of 1944, the Wehrmacht received their heaviest tank destroyer ever -- the Jagdtiger. Built on the King Tiger chassis, its main drawback was its exceptional weight, which gave it low mobility. However, in terms of armor and firepower, this vehicle was unmatched -- its 128mm long-barrelled gun was able to destroy any adversary with ease, and the thickness of its armor maxed out at as much as 250mm."}
        {"hetzer_ger2" "Production of these unsophisticated and cheaply produced tank destroyers started in March 1944 and continued until the end of the war. The 75mm AT gun PaK 39 was mounted on the chassis of a Czech Lt38 light tank, giving the vehicle good mobility. Its compact dimensions, low profile and sloped frontal armor resulted in increased shell resistance but, at the same time, had a negative impact on the amount of ordnance it carried. Despite its insufficient side protection, the Hetzer is widely considered to be one of the most successful vehicles in its class."}
        {"flak38_wheeled_ger2" "Mounted on a wheeled carriage, the FlaK 38 gun was a further development of the FlaK-30 AA gun: lighter, but boasting higher rate of fire. It was used by the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe for anti-aircraft defense. It could, however, be easily employed against infantry and lightly-armored vehicles."}
        {"flak37_ger2" "The 88mm FlaK 18 was an anti-aircraft and anti-tank gun, mounted on a gun carriage that enabled it to fire in all directions. Widespread production started in 1933, and it soon proved to be the best anti-aircraft weapon available, when Germany intervened during the Spanish Civil War. It also turned out to be an excellent anti-tank weapon, as its high muzzle velocity and large calibre gave it the power and range to take out enemy armor. The success of this weapon lead to many variants, and it was one of the most recognizable German weapons throughout the war."}
        {"elefant_ger2" "The Elefant tank destroyer entered service with the Wehrmacht in the spring of 1943. Its cabin-mounted 88mm gun was considered to be the deadliest weapon of its time, and gave it the capacity to destroy most enemy tanks from beyond their range of effective fire. Its armor -- up to 200mm thick -- made the Elefant impervious to frontal attacks, but its resulting heavy weight limited its speed and hindered its cross-country capability."}

The MG 131 was designed for use at fixed, flexible or turreted, single or twin mountings in Luftwaffe aircraft during World War II. It was one of the smallest, if not the smallest among the heavy machine guns, the weight was less than 60% of the M2 Browning or the Breda 12.7 mm. Despite this, the MG 131 was a rapid fire weapon with an elevated firepower for its mass. The nearer equivalent could have been the Ho-103. We don't know why the hell but the Hungarians used this weapon for infnatry support on a tripod with a 30 round magazine."}
		{"40mm_40m" "40mm 40M - This was a Hungarian design. It was effectively a Pak 36 but rebarrelled to fit a Skoda 40mm A17, the standard Hungarian light anti-tank gun.

It was developed in 1938 by Rheinmetall-Borsig AG as a successor to the 37 mm PaK 36, and was in turn followed by the 75mm PaK 40. The PaK 38 was first used by the German forces during the Second World War in April 1941. When the Germans faced Soviet tanks in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, the PaK 38 was one of the few early guns capable of effectively penetrating the 45 mm armor of the formidable T-34. Additionally, the gun was also equipped with Panzergranate 40 APCR shots featuring a tungsten core, in an attempt to penetrate the armor of the heavier KV-1 tank. Although it was replaced by more powerful weapons, it remained a potent and useful weapon and remained in service with the Wehrmacht until the end of the war."}

Its accuracy and effective range exceed that of the Soviet ZIS-3 field artillery gun."}

		{"8cmFKM5" "The 8 cm Feldkanone M 05 was a field gun used by Austria-Hungary during World War I. Guns captured by Italy were used as the Cannone da 77/28 modello 5. It was a conventional design, with its most notable feature being its obsolescent autofrettaged bronze (so-called steel-bronze) barrel, necessary because Austria-Hungary still had trouble making steel of the proper quality.

Although designated a light tank by the Italian Army, its turretless configuration, weight and firepower make it closer to contemporary tankettes. It was the most numerous Italian armored fighting vehicle and saw service almost everywhere the Italians fought in World War II but proved inadequate for modern warfare having too thin armor and weak armament of only machine guns. In 1935, a slightly improved model of the CV-33 was introduced and designated CV-35. The primary differences were that the armour was bolted rather than riveted and the single 6.5 mm machine gun was replaced with twin 8 mm machine guns. Many older CV-33s were retrofitted to meet the specifications of the CV-35. In 1938, the vehicles were redesignated L3/33 ('L' for Leggero or 'light') and the L3/35."}

Four hundred and thirty-four were built; of these the Germans seized two hundred and forty-four when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks acquired fifty-two when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. Others were exported to Bulgaria and Romania. In German service it saw combat during the early years of World War II, notably the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union before being retired or sold off in 1942.

It entered service with the US Army in May 1944, where it earned its nickname: Jumbo. The thick armor of its turret and front hull made it almost invulnerable to enemy guns. Conversely, its increased weight had a negative impact on its speed and cross-country ability. Its 75mm gun could effectively hit firing posts, personnel, and light and medium equipment; however, it proved useless against Germany's heavy tanks"}

		{"m26_pershing" "The heavily armed M26 Pershing entered production in November 1944. Its frontal armor could withstand strikes from Tigers and Panthers and its long-barrelled 90mm gun successfully destroyed enemy tanks at medium and long range. Its heavy weight had a negative impact on its speed, but overall the tank turned out be more effective than other US and British tanks."}
		{"m26e4_pershing" "T26E1 Pershing. The M26 Pershing was a much-needed boost to the fighting capabilities of the American armored units. The M26 would, however, still come to struggle against the newer threat of the Tiger II or \"King Tigers\" dug into the heartlands of Germany. As such, it was decided to up-gun the M26 by installing a more powerful 90 mm cannon, the T15E1."}

		{"m18" "This 18-ton Gun Motor Carriage was remarkable for its excellent speed, and featured a powerful 76mm gun, capable of destroying almost all enemy vehicles. Its excellent mobility and low profile made the M18 a difficult target for enemy guns. However, due to insufficient armor, the vehicles were forced to fire from under cover. Hellcats were also armed with high-calibre anti-aircraft machine guns and were actively used by the U.S. army in Italy and North-western Europe."}
		{"m10wolverine" "Built on the chassis of the M4 Sherman tank, the M10 was the most widely-used US tank destroyer of World War II. Sporting a 3 inch M7 gun it was capable of engaging and defeating enemy armored targets which other US tanks were unable to match. Although it was eventually replaced by heavier anti-tank platforms in response to heavy German armor, it nevertheless set the standard for US tank destroyers and remained in service until the end of the war."}
		{"m36" "The most powerful of all US Army tank destroyers entered mass production in November 1943. Its chassis was taken from its predecessor -- the self-propelled M10A1 anti-tank gun. The good armor penetration capabilities of the modified 90mm gun mounted on the \"Slugger\" allowed it to hold its own against heavy German tanks. Its thick frontal armor protected it from enemy shells and its high manoeuvrability compensated for its one serious flaw -- an open turret that left its crew vulnerable."}
		{"m36b1" "The M36 tank destroyer, formally 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage, M36, was an American tank destroyer used during World War II. The need for 90 mm gunned tank destroyers was so urgent that, during October-December 1944, 187 conversions of standard Medium Tank M4A3 hulls were produced by Grand Blanc Arsenal. These vehicles, designated M36B1, were rushed to the European Theater of Operations and used in combat alongside standard M36s. The M36 was well liked by its crews, being one of the few armored fighting vehicles available to US forces that could destroy heavy German tanks from a distance."}

It was adopted by the British Army at the same time as the enemy's newest heavy tanks were arriving in North Africa. For this reason, mass production of the gun was started as quickly as possible. High armor-piercing performance and excellent ballistic qualities enabled the QF 17 to destroy almost any German vehicle from a long range. However, the gun's excessive weight greatly hindered its transportation."}
		{"vickers" "The 3.7 inch QF AA gun was Britain's answer to the need for a heavy anti-aircraft gun during World War II. It had similar characteristics to the German 88 multi-purpose gun and, while it boasted a slightly larger payload, it almost never saw use as an anti-tank weapon, unlike the German 88. The mounting was not designed for horizontal firing and using it in this role placed undue stress on the unit. However, the potential for the weapon being used in that role was not ignored and the British looked to this weapon for the development of future anti-tank platforms."}

Compared to other light tanks, it boasted thicker armor, as well as a greater manoeuvrability and firepower. An upgraded ZIS-16 engine allowed it to reach high speeds, while its turret-mounted 45mm gun gave it the capacity to penetrate the armor of almost all of its contemporary light and medium tanks."}
		{"ba64" "This light 4WD armored car, equipped with a machine gun, was used by the Soviet Army from 1942 onwards for reconnaissance and protection in combat. Its bullet-proof armor was unable to protect the crew from even small-calibre rounds, but its small size and high ride characteristics made the BA 64 a difficult target for enemy artillery."}
		{"bm13" "The order for mass production of the \"Katyusha\" was signed on June 21, 1941 and, just three weeks later, the rocket launcher appeared on the battlefield in Orsha. Guiding rails for launching M13 rockets were mounted atop a ZIS-6 truck, providing the vehicle with much-needed mobility. Its long range caused the rockets to scatter over a large area, making the weapon unsuitable for pinpoint attacks, but area strikes were highly effective."}
		{"bm37" "Developed in 1937, the Soviet 82mm mortar is a smooth-bore, indirect-fire grenade launcher used to engage enemy personnel and suppress its fortified emplacements. The weapon's construction follows the usual scheme: explosion is triggered by a fixed-pin primer, mounted inside the shell; and a two-legged mount supports the firing tube, providing it with the required firing angle. Reliability, ease of use and mobility made this weapon a popular choice amongst elite infantry troops."}
		{"bishop" "A self-propelled howitzer, mounted on a Valentine tank hull. Its main purpose was to provide the 25-pounder howitzer with a mobile platform. The hurried design process resulted in a few flaws:  the fixed turret turned out to be rather tall which, in combination with the vehicle's low speed, made it an ideal target. Despite this, the Bishop was successfully used as an infantry support weapon and siege gun."}
		{"browning_stan" "The Browning was initially developed for the air force, but in 1923 a different version was developed for ground force use as well. The upgraded version was dubbed the M1919 and was widely used by the US Army.

		{"bt7a" "The BT, or Bystrokhodny tank ('fast tank'), was based on the 'convertible' M1931 Christie tank and produced in the USSR from 1935 onwards. Weighing 13.5 tons, this 'self-propelled gun' version was able to achieve high speeds, while retaining relatively thick armor and high firepower, thanks to its 76mm. The BT was designed to take part in fast raids into enemy territory, and for quick offensive operations without infantry support."}
		{"centurion" "Development of this tank was begun by AEC in August, 1943. Within 2 years, it was being mass produced and had become a classic among the British armored vehicles of its time. The Centurion arrived too late for World War II but, had this not been the case, the German Panthers and Tigers would have had little to no chance of victory in a duel. The new vehicles had an excellent shell-proof capacity and their stabilized long-barrelled 76mm guns could quickly destroy almost any enemy."}
		{"chi-ha120" "This artillery modification of the Chi-Ha tank was custom-made by Mitsubishi for the Imperial Japanese Navy and was used to provide fire support during marine operations. The new, larger turret housed a short-barrelled 120mm gun with a muzzle brake that could easily eliminate enemy infantry and firing positions. Its fairly light armor was generally compensated for by the vehicle being positioned in the rear of attacking forces."}
		{"chi-ha47" "Chi-Ha medium tanks of Mitsubishi design were adopted in 1937 and became the main body of Japanese armored forces. The vehicle's inadequate protection was partially mitigated by its powerful armament: the shells of its 47mm gun were effective against enemy field works, as well as light and medium armor. The additional machine gun in the rear of the turret protected the tank from infantry attack from the rear."}
		{"chi-ha57" "The first Type 97 Chi-Ha tanks were armed with the 57mm -- a relic from its predecessor, the Type 89. While this tank improved upon many of the previous Imperial Japanese Army armored concepts, it was still insufficient to take on the Allied tanks of that period. The short-barrelled 57mm gun was well suited for eliminating soft enemy targets, but was ineffective against enemy armor. Relegated to a role of infantry support, the task of engaging enemy armor was left to the later Chi-Ha's, which would sport the 47mm cannon with its longer barrel and increased anti-armor capabilities."}
		{"chi-he" "The Chi-He medium tank was blueprinted before World War II, but entered mass production only in 1943. Compared to the Chi-Ha, it was more mobile and had thicker armor, but its obsolete 47mm gun couldn't take on medium and heavy armor."}
		{"chi-nu" "The Chi-Nu was introduced to armored units in 1944, and became the most powerful of all mass-produced tanks in the Imperial Japanese Army. It had decent protection and generally met the requirements of the times. Its larger turret housed a new 75mm Type 3 tank gun that could penetrate even the thick armor plates of heavy armored vehicles. Nevertheless, the Chi-Nu was never used in combat since it was produced to defend the Japanese Archipelago from a projected Allied Invasion -- that never took place."}
		{"chi-ri" "In 1945, Japanese engineers created a prototype of the Chi-Ri medium tank, which was almost equal to Western vehicles. It featured a powerful 88mm long-barrelled gun for dealing with enemy armor, an additional small-calibre cannon on the bow, and two machine guns for eliminating enemy personnel. The BMW designed carburettor engine provided this 37-ton vehicle with excellent driving properties and, together with sufficient armor, should have improved its survivability. The Chi-Ri was never used in combat, however, never making it past the prototype stage."}
		{"chi-to" "In 1944, attempting to create a modern tank on par Western vehicles, the Japanese war machine produced five prototypes of the new Chi-To medium tank. Based on an anti-aircraft gun, its long-barrelled gun could deal with nearly any American tank from a medium range, while its 75mm armor provided good protection from enemy shells. Despite this, economic problems during the final stages of the war prevented Japan from establishing mass production of these prototypes."}
		{"churchill_mk_vii" "The Mk.VII Churchill features several improvements compared to its predecessors. While the Churchill was already known for its heavy armor, the Mk.VII saw an additional, substantial increase in armor, as well as a wider design. This upgrade was coupled with the use of the 75mm Mk V gun. This afforded it a greatly increased payload over the earlier variants, which had relied on a QF 57mm as their primary armament. However, aside from the increased armor, the Mk. VII lacked any increased anti-armor capabilities."}
		{"cometa34" "The A34 Comet I was a British tank, designed to operate within Cromwell tank squadrons, to provide a greater measure of anti-tank capabilities with its 77mm HV gun. During the late stages of the war, the 17 pounder and the 77mm HV gun were the only British guns capable of challenging German armor. The Comet had many other design improvements over the Cromwell, including increased armor and a better suspension. While they entered the war too late to participate in any major battles, it did see combat and saw use beyond the end of World War II."}
		{"crusaderaa2" "The ZSU self-propelled AA gun was created in 1942 on the chassis of the \"Crusader\" cruiser tank. The chassis was left unchanged, but the standard turret was replaced with a purpose-built one, which housed two paired 20mm Oerlikon guns. The gun had an excellent rate of fire and could engage not only planes, but lightly-armored ground targets and infantry, too. Its inadequate armor was compensated for, to a certain degree, by its good mobility."}
		{"crusaderaa1" "The ZSU self-propelled AA gun was created in 1942 on the chassis of the \"Crusader\" cruiser tank. The chassis was left unchanged, but the standard turret was replaced with a purpose-built one, which housed two paired 40mm Bofors guns."}
		{"d1" "The 152mm howitzer entered service with the Red Army on August 8th, 1943. It was designed for indirect fire at enemy personnel, fortifications and trench lines. The D-1 was considered equal to the world's best guns of its class, and its mobility, range and the destructive force of high-explosive rounds made it an almost perfect weapon for its time. On the battlefield, it earned a reputation for being a reliable and accurate artillery piece, boasting excellent ballistic characteristics and high mobility."}
		{"degtyarev_stan" "Vasily Degtyaryov's machine gun design was in use by the Red Army from 1927 until the end of WWII. The weapon turned out to be quite the success: safe, easy to use, and demonstrating a high rate of fire, it was superior to all existing machineguns and its place in the Red Army's arsenal was well-deserved."}
		{"flak37" "The 88mm FlaK 18 was an anti-aircraft and anti-tank gun, mounted on a gun carriage that enabled it to fire in all directions. Widespread production started in 1933, and it soon proved to be the best anti-aircraft weapon available, when Germany intervened during the Spanish Civil War. It also turned out to be an excellent anti-tank weapon, as its high muzzle velocity and large calibre gave it the power and range to take out enemy armor. The success of this weapon lead to many variants, and it was one of the most recognizable German weapons throughout the war."}
		{"flak38_wheeled" "Mounted on a wheeled carriage, the FlaK 38 gun was a further development of the FlaK-30 AA gun: lighter, but boasting higher rate of fire. It was used by the Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe and SS troops for anti-aircraft defense. It could, however, be easily employed against infantry and lightly-armored vehicles."}
		{"gaz67b" "Mass production of GAZ-67 started in October 1943. Although being notably heavier than its American counterparts, this Soviet 4WD car nevertheless enjoyed comparable mobility, while its enhanced cross-country ability, reliability and simplicity, quickly won the Ivan-Wyllis popularity among the soldiers and officers of the Red Army. This vehicle was widely used for transporting medium-ranking command staff and headquarters staff, as well as for reconnaissance, communications and towing light artillery. On some modifications a vertical bar with a machine gun mount was installed."}
		{"gmc_cckw" "The inventory of these trucks includes fuel canisters, repair kits, ammunition, grenades and other ordnance.\nThis army truck was an upgrade of the civilian vehicle ACX-353. During the war, these vehicles were often used to transport cargo, relocate troops and tow artillery. Some modified vehicles could also be used as a fuel trucks."}
		{"gmc_inf" "Inside this truck you will find a repair kit, small arms and light artillery ammo, grenades, mines and other ammunition.\nThis military truck was a modification of the ASKh-353 civilian vehicle. During the war, the majority of these vehicles served to transport loads, redeploy infantry and tow artillery. Some modified vehicles may have been used as petrol tankers."}
		{"grant_m3" "An original, multi-tier design made this American medium tank one of the most recognizable in the world. The right side of its hull housed a 75mm cannon, a second 45mm gun was mounted on the turret and above this was fitted another small cupola which held a machine gun. On the battlefield, the tall hull of the General Lee proved to be too good a target for enemy guns, hence, despite its relatively powerful armament and armor, production was stopped in 1942."}
		{"ha-go" "The Ha-Go was adopted in 1936 and became the most popular tank of the Imperial Japanese Army. Designed by Mitsubishi, the tank proved sufficiently mobile and was simple to produce, operate and repair. Its gun could penetrate a 35mm steel plate at medium range -- enough to deal with lightly armored Chinese vehicles. On the other hand, the Ha-Go's armor couldn't withstand strikes from even small-calibre guns so, in later the stages of the war, these tanks were either partially buried or covered with sandbags and used as stationary firing emplacements."}
		{"ha-to" "In 1944, to increase quantity and quality of mobile artillery in the Imperial Japanese Army, the Japanese war machine produced a small number of Ha-To heavy self-propelled mortars. The semi-armored towing vehicle carried a 300mm gun, capable of demolishing all enemy fortifications or of taking out a heavy tank with a direct hit from its 170kg high-explosive shell. Despite the very high efficiency of this mortar, a unilateral shift towards rocket artillery was considered the correct development course for this type of artillery. As a result, this self-propelled mortar did not enjoy widespread use."}
		{"ho-ha3mgun" "Based largely on the German SdKfz.251, this half-track was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1943. Due to its good cross-country ability, this vehicle could promptly deliver infantry to a battlefield, covering the drop-off point with its 7.7mm machine gun. The half-track's armor plates were slanted at angles sufficient to protect the crew from small arms fire, however, the open top of the infantry section was unable to offer soldiers protection from grenades."}
		{"ho-i" "This light, self-propelled gun was produced in 1942 and adopted by the motorized forces of the Imperial Japanese Army to suppress enemy firing emplacements and provide fire support for attacking infantry. The vehicle had a short-barrelled 75mm Type 99 gun installed on a rotating, two-seat turret, and a 7.7mm bow machine gun. Despite boasting good speed, it nevertheless had insufficient protection and lacked armor-piercing shells in the shell rack, making the Ho-I weak against enemy tanks."}
		{"ho-ni1" "The Ho-Ni self-propelled artillery unit was based on the Chi-Ha medium tank, and entered mass production in 1941. Its riveted conning tower, open at the top and rear, housed a 75mm Type 90 field gun with armor-piercing abilities, making this vehicle a tank destroyer. Its inadequate protection was somewhat compensated for by its good mobility. Its powerful armament proved effective against American light and medium vehicles."}
		{"ho-ni2" "The Ho-Ni II self-propelled artillery unit was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1943 and was used to demolish temporary firing positions and provide fire support for the infantry. The Chi-Ha medium tank chassis carried a conning tower, with an open top and rear, which housed a powerful 105mm Type 99 gun. These vehicles did not have the heavy front armor required for head-on attacks, but were mainly used to eliminate enemy personnel and field works from the rear."}
		{"ho-ri" "The second modification of the Ho-Ri tank destroyer was blueprinted in 1945, designed to be effective against American vehicles of all kinds. The addition of a machine gun, alongside a 37mm tank gun in the bow, proved to be effective complements to the 105mm long-barrelled cannon which was housed in a massive conning tower, and installed onto the Chi-Ri medium tank chassis. Due to Japan's surrender, the project was cancelled during the development phase, so this self-propelled artillery never entered mass production and was never used in combat."}
		{"ho-ro" "The Ho-Ro self-propelled gun saw light after a 150mm Type 38 howitzer was installed on a Chi-Ha medium tank chassis. The resulting piece was introduced to the armored divisions of the Imperial Japanese Army, and was used to suppress enemy emplacements and destroy fortifications. The bulletproof armor partially covering the conning tower did not provide sufficient crew protection, but this was not a requirement when firing from rear positions."}
		{"is1" "This Soviet heavy tank entered production in October 1945, replacing the KV-85. Its very name, the \"Iosif Stalin\", implied that this machine should be a leader in its class, and indeed it managed to fulfil the hopes vested in it. While its weight was almost equal to that of its predecessors, the IS-1 boasted improved protection and an all-cast turret, housing an 85mm D-5T gun with a 48.8 calibre barrel length. The tank was used in offensive operations to break through fortified areas, since it was capable of operating under dense enemy fire, relentlessly shattering the German defenses. The weight of the machine had a negative impact on its ride characteristics, but in such situations speed was of less importance than robust armor and powerful armament."}
		{"is2" "The IS-2 entered into mass production in October 1943. Its long-barrelled 122mm gun was able to destroy German tanks from a long range, and it was considered to be the most powerful Soviet tank of WWII. However, due to its separate ammo hold, the gun's reload time was disturbingly long. Against aircraft and lightly-armored targets, the tank employed a turret-mounted large-calibre machine gun."}
		{"is3" "The Soviet heavy tank IS-3 is one of the strongest tanks of World War II. The first machines in this series went into production in May 1945, and received a baptism by fire during the defeat of the Kwantung Army. When designing the IS-3, all the drawbacks of its predecessors were analysed in detail. The layout of the turret and hull were upgraded and the position of the armor plates at the front were changed, making the machine almost invulnerable. Its 122mm gun destroyed enemy equipment and field fortifications with equal effectiveness; however, its separate loading system still made reloading very slow. A DShK heavy anti-aircraft submachine gun mounted on the turret proved successful against infantry, as well as air and light armored land targets."}
		{"isu122" "The ISU-122 was used as a powerful assault gun, a self-propelled howitzer and a long-range tank destroyer, the same as with the ISU-152 heavy self-propelled gun. However these vehicles differed in their combat use. The primary application of the ISU-122 was as a tank destroyer, while the ISU-152 tended more towards the assault gun role. The ISU-122 had good armor performance but more importantly very good performance with high-explosive rounds."}
		{"isu152" "The ISU-152 heavy, self-propelled artillery piece entered service with the Red Army on November 6, 1943. In comparison to the former SU-152, it boasted better armor, a more reliable IS-1 tank chassis, and a greater effective range for its on-board howitzer. However, the separate loading system had a negative effect on the tank's rate of fire, diminishing its capabilities in tank-to-tank combat. As a result, the large-calibre HE rounds fired by the ISU-152 were mainly used to demolish fortifications and support advancing infantry. To protect the vehicle from close-range attack, it was equipped with a top-mounted large-calibre DShK machine gun."}
		{"isuzutx40" "Inside these trucks you will find a petrol can, a repair kit, small arms rounds, grenades and other ammunition.\nBased on the Isuzu series, what turned out to be the most popular truck of the Imperial Japanese Army was first released in 1933. It had a simple design, no foreign parts and was easy to produce. These trucks carried infantry, towed pieces of artillery, and also served as fuel trucks and water carriers."}
		{"isuzutx40art" "Inside these trucks you will find armor-piercing and high-explosive shells, a crate to transport them, and a repair kit.\nBased on the Isuzu series, what turned out to be the most popular truck of the Imperial Japanese Army was first released in 1933. It had a simple design, no foreign parts and was easy to produce. These trucks carried infantry, towed pieces of artillery, and also served as fuel trucks and water carriers."}
		{"isuzutx40_aa" "When Japan started the battle for control over the Pacific islands, the question of taking on the American air forces became critical. The stationary anti-aircraft guns of the Imperial Japanese Army were unable to protect its tank columns while on the march, so the necessity of creating mobile AA equipment became obvious. The solution was simple: a 20mm autocannon, based on a German design, was installed onto a truck. The resulting vehicle could successfully eliminate airborne and lightly armored ground target, and suppress infantry."}
		{"isuzutx40_eng" "Inside this truck you will find repair tools, field work materials, and anti-personnel and anti-tank mines. Obstacles are usually built in front of friendly positions, or sometimes on their flanks and in the gaps between them. Breastworks are made of sandbags and serve to strengthen friendly infantry positions.\nThe most popular truck of the Imperial Japanese Army was based on Isuzu series vehicle, and was released in 1933. It had a simple design, no foreign parts and was easy to produce. These trucks carried infantry, towed pieces of artillery, and also served as fuel trucks and water carriers."}
		{"isuzutx40_inf" "Inside these trucks you will find a repair kit, small arms rounds, light artillery shells, grenades, mines and other ammunition.\nThe most popular truck of the Imperial Japanese Army was based on Isuzu series vehicle, and was released in 1933. It had a simple design, no foreign parts and was easy to produce. These trucks carried infantry, towed pieces of artillery, and also served as fuel trucks and water carriers."}
		{"isuzutx40_mort" "This 120mm heavy infantry artillery gun was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1942 and was used to eliminate enemy personnel and guns. The Type 2 proved to be simple to operate but, with its powerful high-explosive shells and long range, was extremely effective . Moreover, the curved trajectory of its shells allowed it to hit targets that were inaccessible to direct fire. Due to its combat weight of 260kg, the guns were not easy to transport and were delivered to the battlefield via special trucks, along with their crews and ammo."}
		{"k61" "The 61-K was a 37mm anti-aircraft gun of Soviet design, used during World War II. Though it was developed independently, it shared many of its characteristics with the Bofors 40mm cannon, used by the majority of the Western allies. It was effective against aircraft at both low and medium altitudes, and also proved its usefulness against lightly-armored ground targets."}
		{"ke-nu" "The Ke-Nu emerged in 1944, as a result of Japanese engineers' efforts to improve the specs of the Ha-Go light tank. The front armor was reinforced to 25mm (which, however, did not add to the vehicle's survivability), and the old gun was replaced with a 45mm piece, capable of tackling light and medium armor. However, by that time, the basic vehicle design had become so old that no upgrade would prove capable of breathing new life into it."}
		{"dshk_stan" "The DShK 1938 is a Soviet heavy machine gun firing the 12.7x108mm cartridge. The weapon was also used as a heavy infantry machine gun, in which case it was frequently deployed with a two-wheeled mounting and a single-sheet armour-plate shield. It took its name from the weapons designers Vasily Degtyaryov, who designed the original weapon, and Georgi Shpagin, who improved the cartridge feed mechanism."}
		{"kv1" "World's first mass-produced tank with anti-artillery armor entered service with the Red Army on December 19, 1939. Until the arrival of the German Tigers, the KV-1 was virtually invincible: its 76mm main gun was capable of defeating any enemy tank, and German guns were unable to penetrate its thick frontal armor."}
		{"kv2" "Entering into service with the Red Army in the early 1940s, the KV-2 was virtually impervious to enemy anti-tank weapons. However, due to its low manoeuvrability and slow rate of fire, it was mainly used as a siege weapon."}
		{"kv85" "First entering into service with the Red Army on August 8, 1943, and actively used in battle throughout 1944, the KV85's low manoeuvrability was balanced out by its thick armor and powerful 85mm gun, which was capable of defeating almost all medium and heavy tanks."}
		{"m114" "This heavy field howitzer design was based on the old 155mm French guns and entered into mass production in 1941. Intended for indirect fire on enemy personnel, fortifications and important shallow objectives, the M114 proved to be an excellent tool on the battlefield, and its easy maintenance, good ballistics and sturdy construction made it popular among US artillery troops."}
		{"m1mortar" "The design of this US-produced mortar was purchased from French engineer Edgar Brandt. The smoothbore tube rested upon a rectangular support plate and was supported by a simple, two-legged mount -- this standard scheme allowed the mortar to fire fragmentation, incendiary and illumination shells along a plunging trajectory. Fire was triggered by the shell primer descending upon a fixed pin inside the tube."}
		{"m1_57mm" "QF6 is a 57mm gun which saw use primarily in anti-tank roles throughout World War II. The quick-firing 6 pounder gun had a significant impact on the battlefield when it made its combat debut in May 1942. However, with the introduction of much heavier German armor, the QF6 was only effective at relatively close ranges. Despite this, it remained the primary anti-tank gun used in infantry units and was successful enough for the US Army to adopt it into their service as a replacement for the 37mm M3."}
		{"m2a1l" "The M2A1 was the standard field howitzer fielded by the United States. This field gun found wide use in both the Pacific and the European theatre. The gun was capable of firing its 105mm 20kg high-explosive ammunition at distances of 11 kilometres and more. The design was so successful that it was used well past the end of the war and some forms are still in use today."}
		{"m3" "This armored half-truck was produced by the US from 1941 onwards, and used as a transport vehicle for tank corps and artillery divisions. Some vehicles were delivered to USSR as part of a lend-lease program. The spacious hull was made open-top. Along with a compartment designed to take eight soldiers, it housed a large-calibre machinegun, with mounts for additional machineguns on the rear and sides. The M3 proved to be a fast and reliable vehicle, well-suited for use in the harsh conditions of war."}
		{"m30_1938" "The M-30 a 122mm howitzer of Soviet design was, in fact, a modernization of the 122mm howitzers employed by the Red Army during World War I. This allowed the newer artillery piece to make use of ammunition which had already become familiar among the Red Army. While initially this artillery piece represented but a small fraction of the total artillery service, its percentage increased rapidly as older designs were lost in combat."}
		{"m37" "The legendary \"Sorokopyatka\" entered service with the Red Army on April 24, 1938 and became the main artillery gun during the early stages of war. Along with its high rate of fire, its compact design and a low shield plate allowed it to be easily concealed, while its high mobility permitted its operators to change positions quickly. After the appearance of the new German tanks it became largely obsolete and was mainly used against lightly armored targets, or for infantry support."}
		{"m3cannon" "Mass produced since 1940, this light gun became the standard issue AT weapon of the US infantry during the early stages of the war. Having a relatively high rate of fire and fair mobility, it successfully engaged light vehicles and infantry, but the increasingly thick armor of German tanks caused these guns to rapidly become obsolete."}
		{"m4a3m" "This 1942 Sherman tank modification was built to clear minefields with a special mine flail. The engine-powered spinning rotor, with its steel chains and balls attached, was mounted in front of the vehicle on two arms. The rotation caused the chains to hit the ground, exploding all mines in front of the vehicle. The turret of these tanks was often removed, leaving nothing but a machine gun for defense."}

		{"m4a3vc" "Refitted with a British 17-pounder gun, the Sherman VC entered production in 1944 and was widely used by the Allies during the last months of the war. The high velocity of the new, long-barrelled, anti-tank gun allowed it to penetrate armor as thick as 100mm. The tank's own armor was also enhanced. The Firefly performed well on the battlefield and a mounted large-calibre AA machine gun added to its efficiency."}
		{"m4a3_75" "The Sherman entered mass production in 1942. Despite being the strongest US tank at the time, it could not compete with the German tanks -- its high profile and weak armor, along with the poor performance of its main gun, contributed to the overall vulnerability of the tank. Nevertheless, thanks to its relatively low production cost, the Sherman functioned as the main battle tank of the Allies."}
		{"m4a4" "The Sherman entered mass production in 1942. Despite being the strongest US tank at the time, it could not compete with the German tanks -- its high profile and weak armor, along with the poor performance of its main gun, contributed to the overall vulnerability of the tank. Nevertheless, thanks to its relatively low production cost, the Sherman functioned as the main battle tank of the Allies."}
		{"m4a4_firefly" "The Firefly was put into production in early 1944 and was based on the American M4A4 Sherman. It fitted a powerful 17pdr gun that was capable of penetrating most German heavy armor of that time. Despite the Firefly's superior anti-tank capabilities, the tank was regarded as inferior to the regular M4A4 against soft targets such as enemy infantry, buildings and lightly armored vehicles."}
		{"m5" "In late 1940, US engineers undertook the project to adapt the 3-inch anti-aircraft gun T9 to an anti-tank role. The result was named the M5, and it entered service with the US Army in December 1942. Thanks to the high muzzle velocity of its round and its excellent armor penetration capabilities, this gun succeeded in replacing the early AT guns which were quickly becoming ineffective against new German tanks."}
		{"m72" "The M72 \"Dnepr\" army motorcycles entered mass production in 1941, following a decision to form motorcycle troops within the Red Army. The side-car model came equipped with a 7.62mm DP machine gun and earned the soldiers' respect for being reliable and fast."}
		{"mg42_stan" "With an approximate rate of fire of 1200 rounds per minute, the MG 42 is a weapon capable of putting a stunning amount of suppressive fire on the enemy. The MG 42 had proven itself to be reliable and durable in the field, and was more economical to manufacture than previous machine guns. On the battlefield, the sound of an MG 42 was distinct, as it boasted a rate of fire nearly twice that of the allied machine guns. This was often a terrifying prospect for those allied soldiers that had to face it."}
		{"mk2a" "Allied forces began to field Matildas in 1940. The concept behind this British infantry tank was a strengthened armor, which cost it both speed and firepower. Indeed, the German 37mm AT guns were unable to penetrate the Matilda's armor, but the weak armament and low mobility of these tanks made them poor performers in tank duels, mainly relegating them to the role of infantry support."}
		{"mk2daimler" "The Daimler, developed in 1939, was considered to be the most successful British wheeled armored car of WWII. The welded hull had good slope angles which protected the crew from bullets and fragments, while the six-cylinder carburettor engine and all-wheeled drive provided the vehicle with great speed and manoeuvrability. The fully revolving turret was equipped with a machine gun and a 40mm cannon, to combat lightly-armored targets."}
		{"mk3" "This British infantry tank, which entered service in 1940, could be considered 'light' in terms of its 16 ton  weight, although its armor surpassed that of some medium tanks. \"Valentine\" was distinguished by its simple construction and the reliability of its engine, but its weak armament made it unable to deal with most enemy tanks. It was widely used on all fronts in an infantry support role."}
		{"mk4" "The first production models of this new infantry support tank appeared in June 1941. The design was intended to replace the Mk.II \"Matilda\", which was quickly becoming obsolete but, due to a short development cycle, it was sent to production with a range of defects. The tank had a low profile and strong armor, but its extremely weak armament negated these advantages. Further modifications did not help -- a newly mounted 75mm gun did not improve its anti-tank capabilities, leaving the Mk.IV with the role of an infantry support vehicle."}
		{"mk6" "Mass production of the 20-ton Crusader cruiser tank began in 1940. This highly mobile and well-armored vehicle made its first appearance in North Africa, posing a real threat to Rommel's Afrikakorps. Its 1942 modification featured a 57mm gun, with armor-piercing rounds capable of destroying almost any tank at that time. However, its efficiency was reduced once Germany adopted newer and heavier armored vehicles."}
		{"mk7" "Perhaps one of Great Britain's most original military projects was that developed in the 1930s by Vickers-Armstrong Limited, as a typical cruiser tank. Tetrarchs were distinguished by their high mobility, excellent steering and extremely low weight, allowing it to be used in airborne operations. The armor-piercing rounds from the tank's 40mm gun were effective against light enemy vehicles, however, its own light armor could not protect its crew from high-calibre bullets."}
		{"cromwell_mk_vii" "One of the most widely used British cruiser tanks entered mass production in January 1943: the modified version of the Crusader tank. Although the turret-mounted 75mm gun was unable to penetrate the frontal armor of the newest German tanks, the Mk.VIII Cromwell was respected by tank crews for its speed and manoeuvrability. The tank was designed for quick penetration deep into enemy territory and for strategic initiative support."}
		{"ml3" "Adopted by the British Army in 1920, this 3-inch infantry mortar was often used to provide fire support for attacking and defending infantry. The gun had a high rate of fire and its simple design allowed the shortest firing time under artificial or natural cover."}
		{"pak36" "The PaK 36 being a small-calibre weapon, it was found to be inadequate against allied medium and heavy tanks. Still, the gun was effective against the most common light tanks. During the initial phases of Operation Barbarossa the PaK 36 could still penetrate the majority of Soviet tanks at ranges up to 1000m from the front."}
		{"pak38" "The 50mm PaK 38 was the successor to the 37mm PaK 36, and the predecessor to the 75mm PaK 40. When the Soviets introduced their T-34, the PaK 38 was one of the few anti-tank guns capable of penetrating its armor at the time. Though this weapon was replaced by the PaK 40 and other more-powerful anti-tank weapons, the PaK 38 remained in useful service until the end of the war."}
		{"pak40" "The first guns of this type appeared during the spring of 1942, on the Eastern Front. The PaK 40 was designed to take on tanks and armored vehicles, however, its fairly large calibre and the availability of high-explosive rounds allowed it to be used to suppress weapon emplacements, demolish light fortifications and eliminate enemy personnel. Its accuracy and effective range exceed that of the Soviet ZIS-3 field artillery gun."}
		{"pak47" "Before the World War II, Japan realized that their 37mm anti-tank guns would be ineffective against the newest British and Soviet tanks. For this reason, it was decided to develop a more advanced gun that would become the Japanese infantry's standard means of dealing with enemy vehicles. The result was indexed the \"Type 1\" and introduced to the Army in 1941. Battles on Pacific islands had proved that 37mm guns could not inflict sufficient damage to American tanks, but were effective against temporary firing positions and lightly armored vehicles."}
		{"pak57" "While the Type 1 47mm anti-tank gun proved effective against light allied vehicles, it did little to halt the allied medium tanks which were making their appearance in the Pacific War. It was thought that the Type 2 57mm cannon could fill this role whilst more permanent measures were sought. Its slightly larger calibre afforded this weapon greater anti-armor capabilities than its predecessor, but while it did indeed prove to be slightly more effective against tanks, it was still clear that a more powerful weapon was needed."}
		{"pz1" "The Flakpanzer I is a self propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer I chassis. Up to this point, motorized flak vehicles had been unarmored, and prone to small arms fire and other common weapons. Joining a Flak 38 to the readily available Panzer I chassis provided a minimal amount of protection, and the vehicle also had substantial anti-aircraft and anti-infantry capabilities due to its 20mm cannon. However, it still lacked sufficient protection for combat use and crews suffered high casualty rates."}
		{"pz1b" "Thanks to its six-cylinder Maybach engine, the Pz.I light tank -- mass produced since July 1943 -- was fast and manoeuvrable, while its turret-mounted double machine guns proved to be excellent against enemy infantry. However, its light armor and lack of sufficient armament rendered the Pz.I useless in tank battles."}
		{"pz3" "The PzKpfw III entered mass production in September 1939. One year later, it received improved armor, as well as a new, long-barrelled 50mm gun. The tank was able to successfully engage and destroy armored cars and light tanks, although with the appearance of the T-34 it became largely obsolete."}
		{"pz3f" "The PzKpfw III Ausf. F was intended to fight alongside other tanks, using the same 37mm PaK 36 type gun favoured by the infantry at that time. This cannon provided adequate armament until 1940. Thankfully, the Panzer III design accommodated a larger armament, greatly increasing its lifespan once a larger cannon was required."}
		{"pz3m" "In order to clear minefields, German engineers developed a special mine roller. When mounted upon the chassis of a Pz.Kpfw.III tank, it allowed the vehicle to drive through minefields unharmed. The resulting corridors were then used by infantry and ordinary tanks. It was armed with only a machine-gun."}
		{"sdkfz234" "The SdKfz 234 armored, all-wheel drive vehicle was mass produced in 1943. Thanks to sloping armor plates, the hull protected the crew not only from shell fragments and infantry weapons, but also from low-calibre artillery fire. Moreover, the powerful engine allowed the vehicle to achieve high speeds, and its armament proved to be very effective against enemy infantry and lightly-armored vehicles, winning the \"Puma\" the rightfully deserved title of 'best armored car of WWII'."}
		{"sdkfz251_1" "The SdKfz 251 half-track armored vehicle entered service with the Wehrmacht in the summer of 1939. It was widely used as a means of troop transportation along the Soviet-German front, but because of its open top, the crew was not given sufficient protection. Apart from seating, the infantry compartment also contained mounts for several machine guns. The Hanomag engine allowed this 9-ton vehicle to achieve high speeds, while sloping armor plates provided some protection to the transported infantry."}
		{"sdkfz4" "The smoke trails left by the Nebelwerfer's rocket volley exposed its position, making it very vulnerable to counter-attacks, so it was decided to mount this weapon on a mobile platform. The first versions of the Sdkzf.4 with a mounted rocket launcher entered service with the Wehrmacht in early 1944. Bullet-proof armor and a fair degree of manoeuvrability increased the vehicle's overall resilience, while a volley of ten 150mm rockets was capable of inflicting devastating damage on the enemy."}
		{"sfh18" "In production since 1918, the SFH-18 heavy field howitzer was used by the Wehrmacht troops during WWII, against enemy artillery and personnel, as well as fortifications and trench lines. It fired 43kg HE rounds, capable of dealing devastating damage at very long distances, but the gun's heavy weight impaired its mobility."}
		{"sgrw42" "The design of this 81mm gun closely follows its Soviet counterpart, consisting of three main sections: the firing tube, support plate and a two-legged mount. It fires 3.5kg HE rounds via indirect trajectory. Firing is triggered by the pin inside the tube striking the primer of a descending shell."}
		{"ss-d" "In 1931, Japanese engineers developed a combat engineering vehicle, indexed \"SS\", as a means of demolishing Soviet pillboxes along the Manchurian border, . The Type 89 medium tank chassis provided good driving properties, while its large number of various devices (tiltable plow sweep, tow hook, bridgelayer, etc.) allowed it to penetrate obstructions, minefields and anti-tank ditches. Alongside the Type 99 machine guns, this vehicle could carry up to five flamethrowers, turning it into an effective means of dealing with enemy infantry."}
		{"su100" "This vehicle entered service with the Red Army on July 3, 1944 and was basically a further developed version of the SU-85. Thanks to its high rate of fire and the great ballistic properties of its new 100mm gun (based on a naval flak gun), it could destroy any enemy tank from medium and long distances. The tank's hull was welded from thick, sloping armor plates, and the chassis was taken from the T-34/85. The combination of great firepower, heavy armor and fair mobility made the SU-100 one of the best armored vehicles of the Great Patriotic War."}
		{"su122" "This Soviet self-propelled gun was developed in record-breaking time; less than a month passed between the start of the design process and its adoption by the Red Army. Its high calibre, high-explosion round had a substantial destructive effect. This enabled the SU-122 to fight not only field fortifications, but also long-term enemy fortified structures. The chassis of the T-34 medium tank ensured it excellent mobility which, together with a low profile and reasonably good armor, had a positive impact on its ability to survive. Although such self-propelled guns normally moved in the rear echelon of advancing troops, the absence of a machine gun to fight enemy infantry was its one major drawback."}
		{"su76" "The SU-76 entered mass production during the autumn of 1942. A chassis from the light T-70 tank provided it with great speed and manoeuvrability, while the turret-mounted ZIS-3 field gun showed excellent performance in battle. Its one significant disadvantage was its incomplete, weak armor. Despite that, the SU-76 was successful in defeating light and medium enemy tanks."}
		{"su85" "Created in 1943, the SU-85 self-propelled artillery piece was designed to fight against the newly appearing Tiger and Panther tanks. The upgraded 85mm D-5S anti-aircraft gun was mounted atop the T34's chassis, combining the latter's great speed and manoeuvrability, with formidable firepower. The SU-85 was largely used to provide fire support to T-34s and advancing infantry."}
		{"t26" "The two-turreted Vickers-E tank entered service with the Red Army on February 13th, 1931. Designated the T-26, from 1939 onwards it was produced as a single-turret vehicle, armed with a 45mm gun and sloped hull armor plates. By the start of war, the tank had already become obsolete, but some were still used for recon missions and infantry support."}
		{"t34m" "A T34 modification, designed specifically to deal with minefields, saw the introduction of the PT-3 mine trawl, consisting of two rollers installed on a forward platform. Considered unnecessary, the tank's gun turret was often removed, leaving the vehicle with just a machine gun."}
		{"t34_0" "The first version of the famous T34 tank entered mass production on March 31st, 1940. Despite being relatively thin, its armor plates had a large slope angle, which increased the hull's resistance to enemy shelling, as well as its overall speed and mobility. As a result, the T-34, equal to the Pz.Kpfw.III and Pz.Kpfw.IV in terms of armor and armament, turned out to be faster and more manoeuvrable."}
		{"t34_1" "This version had a long-barrelled anti-tank gun, able to compete with the outstanding German KwK40 in terms of armor penetration and ballistic characteristics. The armor and chassis remained the same: armor plates sloped at 30 degrees, providing the relatively thin hull with good resistance to shelling, while the 500hp diesel engine guaranteed excellent speed and manoeuvrability."}
		{"t34_2" "The 1943 version differs from its predecessor in terms of improved armor and a roomier, six-sided turret, which allowed the designers to equip the tank with an upgraded 76mm F34 gun and supply it with more ordnance. These changes did not affect the already outstanding advantages of the most prominent Soviet medium tank -- its speed and manoeuvrability of the T34s remained unchanged."}
		{"t34_3" "This modification entered service with the Red Army on January 23rd, 1944. In order to mount a powerful 85mm anti-tank gun, some changes had to be introduced into its turret design: it became larger and more heavily protected. Its side and rear armor was also enhanced, which, in combination with its sharp slope angle, significantly increased the shell resistance of the hull. As a result the T-34's weight increased to 32 tons, making the tank a bit slower, but its combat efficiency rose significantly."}
		{"t60" "In September 1941, the T-60 light tank entered mass production, demonstrating excellent combat efficiency for three more years. Its excellent manoeuvrability and cruising range led the tank to be promoted to recon missions. The tank's frontal armor, skewed at a reasonable angle, could withstand fire from large-calibre machine guns and small-calibre cannons. Moreover, its autocannon allowed it to eliminate lightly armored targets while on the move. Thanks to its excellent driving properties and low profile, the Germans called these tanks \"ineradicable locusts\"."}
		{"t70" "What was to become the most-produced Soviet light tank of World War 2 was first commissioned by the Red Army in January 1942. It differed from its predecessors in its improved armor, lower profile and higher manoeuvrability. A quiet engine provided the machine with excellent speed and allowed it to stealthily access the enemy rear, allowing the T70 to attack the most vulnerable enemy areas with its 45mm gun. At the same time, poor protection from rounds of all calibres made this tank a perfect target for enemy gun, which is why it was used only for reconnaissance and direct infantry support."}
		{"t90_75m" "The best field gun of the Imperial Japanese Army was based on the 3-inch French gun, designed in 1897, and was the only Japanese artillery piece to feature a muzzle brake. An experienced crew could fire up to 16 shells per minute, while the longer barrel provided for high initial missile velocity. Thanks to these features, Type 90 guns were used effectively in the Pacific islands and could even handle with new American tanks."}
		{"t91_105m" "The Type 91 howitzer was introduced to the Imperial Japanese Army in 1931 and was first used during the war with China. Its 105mm high-explosive shells packed a powerful  punch, easily destroying enemy field works and fortified areas. The gun's armor plates partially protected the crew from shell fragments and bullets, but could not protect them from a direct hit."}
		{"type1hmg_stan" "A modification of the Type 1 heavy machine gun, using 7.7mm rounds, was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1941. Its high rate of fire and long range made it effective against enemy infantry, while the 4x telescopic sight provided increased accuracy."}
		{"type2_20mm" "This 20mm machine cannon was created by Japanese engineers, based on the German FlaK 30. After certain modifications, the gun was indexed the \"Type 2\", and was adopted by the Army where it proved effective against airborne and lightly armored ground targets, as well as infantry."}
		{"type4_200mm" "Aided with technical support from their German allies, Japanese engineers were able to gain vital rocket artillery construction experience. The limited capabilities of their national industry forced them to rely heavily on improvisation. Thus, in 1943, they created the Type 4 rocket mortar that used 84kg high explosive shells. The gunpowder-based engines which were attached to the shells could not provide sufficient range and accuracy, so all fire effect was primarily achieved by use of a large number of launchers."}
		{"type4_75mm" "The Type 4 75mm anti-aircraft gun was a reverse engineered Bofors anti-aircraft gun, which was found to have superior performance compared to the existing Japanese Type 88 75mm anti-aircraft gun. While used primarily for anti-aircraft purposes, this weapon was also found to be effective against armored targets, and a variant of this weapon was adapted for the Chi-To medium tank."}
		{"type93scout" "This armored car was developed in 1943 to support marine operations on land. Its riveted hull and turret protected the crew inside from bullets and shell fragments, while four machine guns (bow, turret and two sponson guns) provided solid covering fire at drop-offs. Thanks to its good driving properties, the vehicle could quickly deliver fast response teams to critical areas, allowing Japanese command to achieve vital operational benefits."}
		{"type94" "This 90mm Japanese infantry mortar was adopted in 1934. It was widely used in China and Indo-China, as well as on the Pacific islands. Thanks to its high rate of fire and rather powerful high-explosive fragmentation ammo, the Type 94 was widely used by the Imperial Japanese Army for supporting friendly infantry, and eliminating enemy infantry. The simple assembly and transport of this mortar meant it required little more than a few minutes to establish a firing position and get the tube ready."}
		{"type96_150mm" "The 150mm Type 96 was the primary towed artillery employed by the Imperial Japanese Army throughout World War II. Based on its European counterparts, the Type 96 performed remarkably well and replaced the aging Type 4 howitzer. The Type 96 proved to be effective in its role, and its modern design earned it a place in the Japanese arsenal."}
		{"type97" "In 1935, Sankyo Co. purchased a license from Harley Davidson to produce motorcycles. The Japanese modification was appreciated and adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army, where it was further modified and indexed as the \"Type 97\". These motorcycles performed well on the fronts of mainland Asia, but their use was greatly limited by the bad roads and dense jungles of the Pacific islands."}
		{"vickers_stan" "The Vickers medium machine gun first appeared in Great Britain in 1912 as a modification of the famous Maxim gun and was subsequently used by the British Army until the 1960s. The machine gun offered an excellent rate of fire at long range but its heavy weight made transportation difficult."}
		{"willysat" "This reliable, undemanding all-terrain jeep was manufactured for the US Army from 1941 onwards. Thanks to its excellent ride performance and strong cross-country ability, the Willys quickly gained popularity amongst American military personnel. On some models, a special vertical bar was installed, carrying a pair of mounted rocket grenade launchers. This feature meant that the vehicle could be used as an auxiliary tool for providing fire support for the troops, by fighting enemy armored vehicles."}
		{"willysmb" "Over a short period of time, three US companies -- Willys, Ford and Bantam -- worked together to develop a reliable and efficient off-roader to suit military needs. Production began in 1941, and it quickly proved its worth on the battlefield. Its excellent speed, and its capacity to mount large-calibre machine guns, made the Willys one of the finest army vehicles of WWII."}
		{"zis2" "The ZIS-2 anti-tank gun entered mass production on June 1, 1941, but its production was soon halted, not to be resumed until first German Tiger and Panther tanks appeared on the field of battle. Due to a specially designed breech-block, this long-barrelled artillery piece demonstrated a high rate of fire, while also being lightweight and compact. Firing 57mm armor-piercing rounds, it could even penetrate heavy German tanks. Despite all these advantages, its high-explosive rounds were much underpowered, hampering the ZIS's use against enemy personnel or fortifications."}
		{"zis3" "The ZIS-3 was the world's first conveyor-assembled artillery piece. It was highly praised by artillery specialists and, on February 12, 1942, it entered service with the Red Army. Firing armor-piercing rounds, it was able to penetrate 70mm of armor at medium range, while its high-explosive shells demonstrated high stopping power and a great damage radius."}
		{"zis5" "You can scavenge these trucks for fuel canisters, repair kits, ammunition, grenades and other equipment.\nThe 3-ton Soviet ZIS-5 truck was mass produced since the 1930s. Easy to maintain, it could reach reasonable speeds and was used during the war for the transportation of troops, cargo and artillery towing."}
		{"zis5art" "You can scavenge these trucks for fuel canisters, repair kits, ammunition, grenades and other equipment.\nThe 3-ton Soviet ZIS-5 truck entered mass production in the early 1930s. Easy to maintain, it achieved relatively high speeds and was used during the war for transporting troops, cargo and towing artillery."}
		{"zis5eng" "Inside this truck you will find tools for repairing equipment, materials for building obstacles and defenses, and anti-personnel and anti-tank mines. Obstacles are usually built in front of occupied positions or sometimes on the flanks and in the gaps between them. defenses are made of sandbags and serve to strengthen the positions of friendly infantry.\nThe Soviet 3-ton ZIS-5 truck was mass produced during the 1930s. Despite being undemanding, this truck could reach fairly high speeds and, during the war, was used to transport troops, cargo and artillery. It also served as an ambulance and petrol tanker."}
		{"zis5inf" "Inside this truck you will find a repair kit, small arms and light artillery ammo, grenades, mines and other ammunition.\nThe Soviet 3-ton ZIS-5 truck was mass-produced during the 1930s. Despite its simplicity, it could reach fairly high speeds and, during the war, was used to transport troops, cargo and artillery. It also served as an ambulance and petrol tanker."}
		{"zsu37" "A self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, based on the SU-76 chassis. It entered service with the Red Army in 1945. Its 37mm AA-gun was not only effective against enemy aircraft, but could also be used against light and even medium tanks. Its weak armor was well compensated for by good speed and manoeuvrability."}
		{"zis_30" "In 1941, about a hundred Komsomolet armored tractors were upgraded and converted into open-type, self-propelled vehicles, by having long-barrelled 57mm guns mounted on them. The new machines were given the name ZiS-30 and had entered the field by the end of September. The anti-tank guns proved excellent for fighting light and medium enemy equipment, but their insufficient cockpit protection, and the consequent vulnerability of the crew, lead to heavy losses among these SPGs in their very first outings."}
